### OCT 15, 2022

Hello hackers!

**Looking for more ways to support the Community? Here are a few ideas:**

üë©‚Äçüíª Continue in providing feedback on pull requests to help other hackers get their pull request ready to merge. We appreciate your help and love seeing the magic of social coding.

üì™ Have patience. Our team is working hard to get through your pull requests and provide everyone with the feedback needed to join the event. GitHub Actions saved our team an enormous amount of time managing reviews this year but, as much as we love our automations, this is still a manual process to ensure the Code of Conduct is followed and the event can be enjoyed by all.

# How to Setup

### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Hackbook](https://github.com/techhub-community/Hackbook) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button on top-right of your screen.



### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

`NOTE: commands are to be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows(using Powershell)`

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/techhub-community/Hackbook.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.
Once you have cloned the `Hackbook` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on Linux, Mac, and Windows(PowerShell to be used).

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Hackbook
$ cd Hackbook
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Hackbook.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Hackbook.git (push)
```

Now, let's add a reference to the original [Hackbook](https://github.com/techhub-community/Hackbook/) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/techhub-community/Hackbook.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.
See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Hackbook.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Hackbook.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/Hackbook.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/Hacktbook.git (push)
```
